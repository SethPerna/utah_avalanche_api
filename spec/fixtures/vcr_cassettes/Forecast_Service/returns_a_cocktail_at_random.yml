        1st Day of Spring.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\rSkies are overcast.&nbsp; Winds are 15-20mph
        from the south.&nbsp; Temperatures remain mild ahead of the cold front with
        temps in the upper 20s to low 30s.&nbsp;\r\rThe front should arrive mid-morning
        with a good burst of snowfall.&nbsp; We may see 3-6\" by evening.&nbsp; There
        is an outside chance of lake effect by dinnertime.&nbsp;\r\rTemperatures will
        rapidly fall to the low teens post-frontal; winds will veer northwesterly,
        be gusty during frontal passage, but then blow 15-20mph along the higher ridgelines.\r\rWe
        stay under a cool northwest flow for early week with a ridge building for
        mid-late week.&nbsp; Mountain temperatures rise again to well above freezing
        by Thursday.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\rSomething of interest for next weekend; we''ll
        see.\r\r\r\rTravel is easy with excellent coverage, particularly in the upper
        elevations. Base depths are 80-105\" in the upper Cottonwoods and 50-80\"
        along the Park City ridgeline. The mid-week storm of 2-4\" added a little
        window dressing to the landscape, but wind, sun, and thermal crusts abound.
        Still, one can find good riding conditions in the sheltered terrain.\r\r\r","recent_activity":"First

        the most accurate picture of what''s going on in the backcountry.\r\r\r\r\r\tA
        skier remotely triggered an 18\" deep and 30'' wide pocket on a steep northeast
        facing slope at 8200'' in the Eeny-Meenies of Mill B South.&nbsp;\r\tA snowboarder
        triggered, and was caught and briefly carried in an 18\" deep and 80'' wide
        avalanche in Cardiff Fork of BCC.&nbsp; Northeast facing at 9000''.&nbsp;
        Exact location is unknown at this time, but it looked to be a small opening
        in an otherwise forested area.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\tWe did get a second&nbsp;hand
        report of a \"recent\"&nbsp;skier triggered avalanche on the northern flank
        of Mt Aire.&nbsp; Estimated elevation is 7800''.\r\r\rSaturday''s three avalanches
        continue to fit the pattern:&nbsp; tricky and \"unmanageable\" soft slab avalanches
        failing on the Jan/Feb drought PWL&nbsp;layer of weak sugary facets...and
        more prominently noted in north to northeast facing mid-elevation protected
        terrain.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\r\r\rcrown of avalanche in Mill B South 18\" deep 30''

        of avalanche in Cardiff Fork, 18\" deep and 80'' wide\r\r\"Was caught, slid
        20 feet but managed to get a hold of a branch and hang on. The slide ran for
        approximately 200 ft through the timber.\r\rTakeaways: Any momentary lapse
        in judgement is unacceptable. Just because I enjoyed skiing similar aspect
        and slope angle 1500 vert higher doesn''t mean I should lower my guard.&nbsp;Lastly,
        just because I made a small ski cut where I thought it would go and didn''t
        get any signs of instability, doesn''t mean it won''t slide two turns down.\"\r\r\r&nbsp;\r\r\r\rFind

        1-3'' deep remain possible on steep west to north to east facing slopes of
        all elevations.&nbsp; You will probably trigger them from a distance.&nbsp;\r\rThe
        sweet spot for triggering these seems more likely in the wind and sun protected
        north to northeast facing terrain of the mid-elevations.&nbsp; Many of the
        people triggering these slides have remarked that \"the terrain looked so
        benign\", or \"it was just a small opening in the trees\".&nbsp; Understandable
        yet slope angle is slope angle, even if it''s a benign looking slope.&nbsp;
        And trees are not necessarily anchoring the slope per se; they are more likely
        to cause trauma.\r\rPeople have triggered these&nbsp;soft slab avalanches
        failing on our Jan/Feb drought layer facets nearly every day for&nbsp;a month.&nbsp;
        The TAKE-HOME&nbsp;is that a great deal of uncertainty* exists with this tricky
        and dangerous snowpack.&nbsp; Many professionals and many very experienced
        backcountry skiers and riders have been surprised or had close calls in the
        past week and a half.&nbsp; \r\rLet that sit in for a moment.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\rWe
        estimate the danger by looking at the likelihood, size, spatial distribution,
        and character, if you will, of the avalanche.&nbsp; For all intents and purposes,
        the size and locations haven''t changed.&nbsp; What has changed is that these
        avalanches are more stubborn and less sensitive and - lacking immediate signs
        of instability (ie-cracking/collapsing) - will want to lure you out onto the
        steep terrain.&nbsp; Don''t fall for it.&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\r\r\r*Uncertainty.&nbsp;
        High uncertainty requires a&nbsp;wide margin&nbsp;for error.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\r\r\tKnow
        that you don''t know.&nbsp; You won''t know exactly when and where you will
        trigger the avalanche, but you will probably trigger it from a distance.&nbsp;
        These types of avalanches are Unmanageable.\r\tIf you choose to ride suspect
        terrain, choose terrain that won''t kill you if the snowpack disagrees with
        your assessment of it.&nbsp; Bashed through the trees, over a cliff and buried
        deeply in a gulley?&nbsp; No good.\r\tBe cognizant of runout zones.&nbsp;
        How far will the avalanche run if you trigger it from below?&nbsp; Do you
        know how to estimate runouts?\r\r\r\r&nbsp;\r\rTRAVEL ADVICE - CHOOSE LOWER
        ANGLE SLOPES WITH NO OVERHEAD HAZARD.\r\r\r\r&nbsp;\r\r&nbsp;\r\r&nbsp;\r\r&nbsp;\r\r&nbsp;\r\r&nbsp;\r\r&nbsp;\r\r&nbsp;\r\r&nbsp;\r\r&nbsp;\r\r&nbsp;\r\r&nbsp;\r\r&nbsp;\r\r&nbsp;\r\r&nbsp;\r\r\r&nbsp;\r\r&nbsp;\r\r","avalanche_problem_2":"Wind

        danger exists on steep west to north to east facing&nbsp;aspects of all elevations.&nbsp;
        You can trigger 1-3'' deep avalanches and you can trigger from a distance
